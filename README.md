# Book Recommendation System ðŸ“š

This project presents a **Book Recommendation System** that leverages two key approaches: **Popularity-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** to suggest books based on user ratings. The system is built using Python and key machine learning libraries for recommendation systems, making it capable of recommending both general popular books and personalized book suggestions.

## Overview

Book recommendation systems are widely used in online platforms like Goodreads and Amazon. They help users discover new books based on their reading history or general popularity among other readers. This project implements a book recommendation system using the **Book-Crossing dataset**, which contains user reviews and ratings for a wide range of books.

The system implements two types of recommendation engines:
- **Popularity-Based Filtering**: Suggests books that are highly rated by many users.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Provides personalized recommendations by identifying similarities between users' preferences.
